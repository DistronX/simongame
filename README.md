# Simon Memory Game
When the game starts one of the four boxes will flash.

Click the flashing box.

Now the game moves to the next level and a different (or the same) box flashes.

Now click the box that was flashing earlier and then click the newly flashing box.

After progressing to the next level repeat this process and click all the flashing boxes in sequence.

If you forget the sequence and click a wrong box, the game ends.
