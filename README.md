# Simon Memory Game
When the game starts one of the four boxes will flash.

Click the flashing box.

Now the games moves to the next level and a different (or the same) box flashes.

Now click the box that was flashing earlier and then click the most recently flashing box.

After progressing to the next level repeat this process and click all the boxes in sequence.

If you forget the sequence and click a wrong box, the game ends.
